1. Market Regime Detection
- The system identifies 4 distinct market regimes using multiple factors:
```python
- Trend Features:
  - Price moving averages and their changes
  - ADX (Average Directional Index) for trend strength

- Volatility Features:
  - Rolling standard deviation of returns
  - Volatility change rates
  - ATR (Average True Range)

- Volume Features:
  - Volume trends
  - Relative volume compared to moving averages
  - OBV (On-Balance Volume)
  - VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)

- Momentum Features:
  - Rolling returns
  - Momentum change rates
  - RSI and MACD indicators
```

2. Adaptive Parameter Optimization
- The system continuously optimizes parameters using a rolling window approach:
```python
Key Parameters Optimized:
- Stop-loss levels
- Take-profit targets
- Risk-per-trade limits
- Leverage limits
- Confidence thresholds

Optimization Objective:
- Maximizes Sharpe ratio
- Minimizes drawdown
- Includes risk penalties for excessive leverage
- Uses constrained optimization with realistic bounds
```

3. Enhanced Risk Management
```python
Position Sizing:
- Base size calculated using ATR
- Adjusted for market regime
- Modified by sentiment scores
- Limited by maximum leverage

Dynamic Risk Levels:
- Stop-losses adapt to volatility
- Take-profit levels scale with market conditions
- Position sizes reduce in high volatility
- Additional risk controls in trend-opposing trades
```

4. Market Sentiment Integration
```python
Sentiment Sources:
- News headlines analysis
- Market news sentiment scoring
- Sentiment trend tracking
- Sentiment volatility measurement

Signal Modification:
- Reduces position sizes in sentiment contrary to signal
- Blocks trades in extreme sentiment conditions
- Adjusts risk parameters based on sentiment volatility
```

5. Signal Generation Process:
```python
1. HMM State Prediction:
   - Identifies market state (bearish, neutral, bullish)
   - Calculates state probabilities
   - Requires minimum confidence threshold

2. Signal Confirmation:
   - Technical indicator alignment
   - Market regime compatibility
   - Sentiment confirmation
   - Volume validation

3. Position Sizing:
   - Base size from risk parameters
   - Regime adjustment multiplier
   - Sentiment adjustment multiplier
   - Final leverage check
```

6. Trade Management:
```python
Entry Rules:
- State probability > confidence threshold
- Regime alignment
- Sentiment confirmation
- Technical confirmation

Exit Rules:
- Dynamic stop-loss hit
- Take-profit target reached
- Regime change
- Sentiment shift
- Technical invalidation

Position Management:
- Size scaling based on conditions
- Partial profit taking
- Stop-loss adjustment
- Risk reduction in adverse conditions
```

7. Performance Monitoring:
```python
Key Metrics Tracked:
- Sharpe Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown
- Win Rate
- Profit Factor
- Risk-Adjusted Returns

Regime-Specific Analysis:
- Performance by regime
- Risk metrics by regime
- Transition analysis
- Regime prediction accuracy
```

8. Adaptive Features:
```python
The system adapts to:
- Changing market regimes
- Volatility conditions
- Sentiment shifts
- Trading performance
- Risk events
```
